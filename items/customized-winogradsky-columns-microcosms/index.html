                <p><b>Mimic the Conditions of Nature</b></p>
                <p>Our understanding of the diversity of bacterial metabolism and its
                    ecological importance got its start at the turn of the 20th century
                    with the work of Sergei Winogradsky and Martinus Beijerinck.
                    They developed techniques to grow different bacteria in the laboratory
                    by mimicking or making use of natural substrates and conditions.
                    Their work furthered that of Louis Pasteur showing there are
                    a lot of different bacteria actively growing under anaerobic
                    (very little to no oxygen) conditions, proved that carbon dioxide
                    could be used to make organic C molecules (food) without the
                    linkage to light energy capture by chlorophyll, and showed for
                    the first time that some bacteria can capture energy from inorganic
                    (lacking C) materials such as ammonium, sulfide, or reduced iron.</p>
                <p>One of the enrichment techniques used by Winogradsky was the establishment
                    of a standing artificial environment supported by exposure to
                    light and applied chemical energy in the form of organic matter
                    (also a C source) and sulfate/sulfide in order to establish a
                    sulfur cycle. In a typical Winogradsky column, some mud and water
                    are mixed with some sulfate and some complex carbon sources such
                    as cellulose. Over time, gradients form with oxygen concentration
                    decreasing from top to bottom and hydrogen sulfide concentration
                    increasing from top to bottom. Different bacterial groups, if
                    present in the original mud and water, grow best and form layers
                    at the appropriate positions in the column with respect to oxygen,
                    light, sulfide, and/or sulfate availability.</p>
                <p><b>Custom-designed Experiments</b></p>
                <p>Hiram Genomics Store can customize the starting conditions for Winogradsky
                    columns according to the experimental design from you and your
                    students. We can provide, at a very reasonable price per column,
                    as many Winogradsky columns as you need in a very easy to use
                    50 ml size. Each custom column will contain 20 ml of sterile
                    sand and whatever sterile materials you want from a menu of choices
                    â€“ C sources (carbonate, cellulose, glucose, acetate), S sources
                    (sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfide), N sources (ammonium), other
                    nutrients (iron, manganese, phosphate). You provide 5-10 g of
                    an environmental sample (mud, soil, gravel, etc.) and water (sterile
                    or connected to your environmental sample) up to the 45 ml mark.
                    Mix it all up, expose your columns to light (you choose the level
                    of light exposure and intensity), and watch what happens.</p>
                <p>The real beauty of Winogradsky columns are all the ways you can study
                    them. You can make visual observations. You can take a whiff
                    from time to time (carefully). You can use a sterile microbiology
                    loop to take a sample for microscopy or for culturing on plates.
                    You can take out a sample, or the whole column, and isolate metagenomic
                    DNA to analyze using PCR or DNA sequencing. The experiment is
                    totally in your hands.</p>
